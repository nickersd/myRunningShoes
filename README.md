myRunningShoes
==============

Sample service.  Keep track of mileage on a user's running shoes.

The service will provide user/shoe data in json. Persistence is done
with a Mysql database with a spring JDBC connection.  The front
end is currently only browser MVC support using angularjs. Eventually an iOS/android app.  Maybe
eventually a map using location services to track the mileage.
